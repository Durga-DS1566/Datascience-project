# Credit Card Default Prediction

This project predicts whether a customer will default on their credit card payment using machine learning and deep learning models.

## Overview

The notebook implements a complete machine learning workflow including:
- Data preprocessing
- Model training
- Model evaluation
- Probability calibration
- Basic model explainability

The goal is to compare different models and evaluate their performance on a credit card default dataset.

## Dataset

- Credit card customer data
- Includes demographic information, billing history, and payment behavior
- Target variable indicates whether a customer defaults on payment

## Models Used

- Logistic Regression  
- XGBoost Classifier  
- GRU-based Deep Learning Model  

## Evaluation

Models are evaluated using:
- ROC-AUC score
- Precision and recall
- Confusion matrix

## Tools & Libraries

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- XGBoost
- TensorFlow / Keras
